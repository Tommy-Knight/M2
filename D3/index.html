    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are a fan of?
            This section is dedicated to him / her / them!
            Feel free to experiment in this part of the page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links
        -->
<footer style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; color: white">This is the footer.<br>Find me @tommy</footer>
    <!-- EXTRA:
            EXERCISE 9
            Create an album details area that is going to be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible) 
            (hint: look for a boostrap component that can handle the job for you. You can always rely on DOM manipulation if you can't find it)
        -->

    <!--
         EXERCISE 11
            Add in the footer a field that counts, on page load, how many ALBUMS there are on the page
